# mr_robot_tribute_page
Basic Front End Development Project 1 for Free Code Camp

I mostly used Bootsrap classes to quicky build the page and just used custom css for things like setting the padding and margin. I might use some jQuery for manipulating the classes and maybe some javascript manipulation if I feel like I finished it faster than usual.
